# jsPlus

### a minimal, opinionated javascript helper library

A small pile of tools I made for my own use on every project where I didn't want to bring in twelve megabytes of javascript just to make using XMLHttpRequest not terrible or whatever.

### Build

 * `yarn gulp build` will build the unminified dev file and the minified version, along with sourcemaps
 * `yarn gulp buildDefs` will generate the typescript definitions
 * `yarn gulp` (the default task) will do both
 * `yarn gulp watch` will auto-rebuild on source changes
