# jsPlus

### a minimal, opinionated javascript helper library

A small pile of tools I made for my own use on every project where I didn't want to bring in twelve megabytes of javascript just to make using XMLHttpRequest not terrible or whatever.

### Build

`gulp build` to build the unminified dev file, `gulp buildMin` to build the minified file, `gulp` (default) to build both, `gulp watch` to auto-rebuild the dev file on source changes.
